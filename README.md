# Food-choices
The goal of the project was to demonstrate data cleaning techniques using Python on a raw dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
The initial dataset contains information regarding the food preferences of students.
It includes numerous missing values, incorrect data types, inconsistent field values, and text data that require coding.

Data cleaning techniques used in the project included:
1. Removing redundant data.
2. Identifying and replacing NaN values with the mode and average depending on the column.
3. Detecting errors in the data and correcting data types.
4. Encoding text columns using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal, regular expressions, counting the frequency of words in text data, setting up data categories, and encoding text data according to these categories." less
